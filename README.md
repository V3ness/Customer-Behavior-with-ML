<h1>Customer Behavior with K-Means Clustering</h1>

## Overview
<p>The aim of this project is simple: To create K-Means clustering on customer data to analyze customer's behavior. The model used in this project is K-Means Clustering, part of unsupervised learning model.</p>

## P.S.
<p>This project is my first time using K-Means clustering to analyze data. In the notebook, the documentation part might not make sense and the code might be of low quality. But this project serves as a remark so that 1 day if I ever advance in this field, I can go back here and see this absolute abomination. </p>
